<h1 align="center">Movie recommender system
</h1>

This is a recommender system built with a collaborative filtering learning algorithm. It was coded in Matlab as part of [Coursera's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) class. 

The recommender system can be run from [`classifier/ex8_cofi.m`](code/ex8_cofi.m). You can enter your own movie ratings on lines 137-154 of the script to get your own list of recommendations. Use the movie IDs listed in [`code/movie_ids.txt`](code/movie_ids.txt).
